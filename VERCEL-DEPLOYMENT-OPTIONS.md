## Option 2: Full-Stack with Backend

If you need backend features (admin panel, contact form processing, etc.):

### Copy Backend Files:
```bash
# Copy backend files from main project
cp -r ../server ./
cp -r ../shared ./
cp ../package.json ./package-fullstack.json
```

### Add Vercel Configuration:
Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "dist/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/index.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Admin panel functionality
- ✅ Contact form processing
- ✅ Database integration
- ✅ Full portfolio management

### Requirements:
- Database setup (Neon/PlanetScale)
- Environment variables
- More complex deployment
